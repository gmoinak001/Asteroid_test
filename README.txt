Directional controls:
W - accelerate
A - rotate left
d - rotate right

Firing controls
Space - Fire primary
Mouse - target and fire nukes.


Destroy all the asteroids to advance a level. Collect square power ups for extra lives and nukes. Nukes track asteroids if you click on the asteroid while firing. Otherwise it just explodes at that point in space.
